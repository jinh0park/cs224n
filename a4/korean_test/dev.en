Caffeine can help increase reaction time and improve performance for military servicemen who must perform complex tasks or who need help staying alert for longer periods of time, according to a new report by the National Academy of Sciences.
"Specifically, it can be used in maintaining speed of reactions and visual and auditory vigilance, which in military operations could be a life or death situation," according to the report.

Researchers are already exploring ways to put caffeine in nutrition bars or chewing gum as alternatives to coffee, Archibald said.
A similar dose of caffeine, about 200-600 mg, also appears effective in enhancing physical endurance and may be especially useful in returning some of the physical endurance lost at high altitude, the study found.

Mobile bomb-fighting robots can already inspect suspicious cars, buildings or mail for explosives or hazardous materials, according to Jan Karlsson, an expert at the U.N.
The Geneva-based commission, in its annual study of the industry titled “World Robotics 2001,” said a record 100,000 robots were installed last year, up 25 percent on 1999.
“There is definitely a much higher incentive to invest in automated technology to fight terrorists,” Karlsson said.
“It could be used in post offices, in surveillance of offices after hours and to inspect suspicious cars.”
Postal Service - whose postmaster told a Senate panel that the financial impact of the anthrax crisis could be several billion dollars - uses robots to sort parcels, but other automated equipment sorts letters.
At the same time, labor costs are more and more.”
“For industrial robots, 2000 was the best year ever,” added the Swede.
“Not only in Japan and Europe and North America, but they have also started to take off in some developing countries, for example in Brazil, Mexico, China and South Africa.”
Annual sales of robot units are estimated at $5 billion to $6 billion.
But with the cost of installing necessary software and integration systems, the total robotics market could be worth closer to $25 billion.
About 50 systems of firefighting and bomb-disposal robots have been sold through 2000 in countries including Israel and Britain.
The study, written before the devastating U.S. attacks, predicts sales of 120 systems by 2004.
About 2,300 robots work in demolition, servicing or dismantling nuclear, chemical, waste or other hazardous complexes, the report said.
Another 60 robots work in surveillance.
“Guard robots are used privately and professionally to detect intruders or fire,” Karlsson said.

China has unveiled plans for the largest water-diversion in its history and possibly one of the world's most expensive at $60.4 billion.
The project will channel water from the country's longest river, the Yangtze, to three rivers in the north, the Yellow, Huai and Hai, whose basins are running dry.
The ambitious South-to-North Water Transfer Project will move water along three channels linking the wetter flood-prone southern basin to parched northern climes.
This is just one of the latest of China's massive public works projects, recent ones including the Three Gorges hydroelectric dam, a proposed 4,000-kilometer natural-gas pipeline and the world's highest railroad from Qinghai to Tibet.
Authorities from the Water Resources Ministry plan to begin construction next year on the controversial and hugely expensive project.
Vice Minister of the Water Resources ministry Zhang Jiyao said plans for the project would be submitted for approval to the cabinet by the end of the year.
Environmental experts say the new project could cause widespread corruption, human hardship and environmental damage, and could dry up the Yangtze in 30 years.
They urge China to take simpler steps like raising water prices, curbing rampant well-digging, stopping up leaks and improving water treatment.

especially if combined with weight-training, a Harvard study of more than 40,000 men suggests.
High-intensity exercise includes running or jogging at 6 mph, while low-intensity activities include walking at a pace of about 2 mph.
Researchers also have debated whether weight-training has a big impact on the heart, since it does not give the heart and lungs the kind of workout they get from aerobic activities such as brisk walking or running for at least 20 minutes.
But in the Harvard School of Public Health study, men who engaged in weight training for 30 minutes or more weekly had a 23 percent lower risk of heart disease than men who did not pump iron.
The researchers said the benefits may result in part from reductions in blood pressure and body fat achieved through weight training.
Given the independent results from weight training, the researchers theorized that adding weight training to a high-intensity exercise program would reap even greater benefits.
The study is based on medical records and questionnaires given periodically to 44,452 health professionals from 1986 to 1998.
Participants were ages 40 to 75 at the outset.
Heart disease was ultimately diagnosed in 1,700 participants.
Men who ran for an hour or more weekly at 6 mph or more were 42 percent less likely to develop heart disease than non-runners.
Men who did brisk walking at a moderate pace of at least 3 mph for at least a half hour daily were 18 percent less likely to develop heart disease than those who did not.
There were no significant heart benefits found from low-intensity walking.

The three wage warriors and millions of fellow countrymen are busy spending future leisure time in their heads, as South Korea considers moving from a six-day workweek to the five-day version that is standard in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe.
Korea also hopes to accomplish the shift in apparent defiance of conventional economic logic.
A government proposal, strongly supported by labor unions, calls for employees to work 300 to 500 fewer hours a year
The government thinks it can pull off this trick because it did so once before.
In 1989, South Korea told companies to trim work hours to 2,500 annually from 2,700 without paring their payrolls.
The big difference this time, employers say, is that South Korea isn't the insular, command economy it was in the late 1980s and its workers aren't exploited, underpaid victims.
The economy is far more dynamic, and workers are well organized, politically active and the beneficiaries of wage increases that routinely outpace productivity.
Labor unions say there's never a perfect time, that higher wages will force South Korea to shift into more sophisticated industries and that employees and Korean society will be happier, healthier and more relaxed.
Koreans toil long hours, but they don't necessarily toil effectively.
According to the International Labor Organization, Koreans work 2,474 hours a year, compared with 1,979 for Americans and 1,859 for the Japanese.
But they're also 62% and 45% less productive, respectively.
Sleeping, eating, lounging, Internet shopping, stock trading and card playing are common during workdays that can last from 8 in the morning until 10 at night.

For Park Kang Woo, policy director of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the solution is clear:
Drop working hours to a reasonable level and you'll see fewer accidents and higher productivity.
There is a precedent.
In 1998, Yuhan Kimberly Corp., a maker of household products, switched to a five-day week without paring paychecks.
Accident and defect rates fell and productivity gains were enough to cover the reduced time, a company spokesman said.
Still, the experience of one internationally managed company doesn't reflect what might happen across an entire economy, economists say, and employers are being asked to pay out in advance what could amount to a 15% hourly wage hike for benefits that may not materialize.
Why the hurry to accomplish such a Herculean feat?
Japan took 10 years to make a similar transition starting in 1987, when it had a per capita income of about $19,000, compared with South Korea's $9,700 today.
Greece and Portugal started their switch-overs in 1997, and are giving themselves a decade as well.
And Hong Kong and Singapore are easing in that direction under a more voluntary process.
The government says the move is a way to show that South Korea is a developed nation.
The change also will boost flagging consumption, spur regional tourism and help local economies as city dwellers head for the country to enjoy nature's beauty.
"It's politically motivated," said Kim of the Korean Employers Federation.
"It's hugely popular, and the government wants to get credit for it, especially with local and national elections coming next year."
Among the many thorny issues is holidays.
Koreans now enjoy 17 national days off, two weeks of annual leave, an added day's vacation per year worked and 12 additional bonus days annually.
Large companies often add three or four more personal days, and women get an additional 12 menstruation days.
Add these to the 52 days gained by not working Saturdays, and South Korea would race to the head of the global vacation class, trumping even the cafe-lounging French.
By some counts, the days-off total could soar as high as 165, compared with France's 145 and the U.S.
Another worry is whether too much relaxation might undermine South Korea's power, accomplishments and work ethic.

An explosion rocked the Israeli town of Hadera killing at least two and injuring more than 36 people, a local Israeli official said.
Israeli TV reported that a car bomb went off next to a bus on Hadera's main Hanassi Street.

The blast was so powerful, it caused the bus to slam into a nearby store.
Several stores also caught fire.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the explosion, although "Izz el-Deen al-Qassam", the military wing of the militant Islamic group Hamas, said in a statement today it would bring death to every Israeli home.
After months of speculation, the elusive gizmo referred to as "IT" or "Ginger" has been unveiled to the public.
The ABC television program "Good Morning America" demonstrated the invention Monday, a two-wheeled, self-propelled scooter that can travel at about 12 mph.
"This is the world's first self-balancing human transporter," Kamen said.
it has a computer that does what your brain does for you.
It's got those tires that do what your feet do for you."
Kamen said the invention - called the Segway HT - will be going out in limited quantities over the next few weeks, and by the end of next year, it should be widely available.
The price is expected to be around $3,000.
Kamen's invention has won over some bigwigs in California's Silicon Valley who have seen Ginger and reportedly thrown money behind it, according to initial reports in January on the news Web site Inside.com.
Investing icon John Doerr has called Kamen a blend of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.
Apple Computer's Steve Jobs was quoted as saying that people will erect entire cities around "IT."
Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has taken a special liking to the invention, featuring it on Amazon's Web site.
News of Ginger was first uncovered when it was revealed that the Harvard Business School Press had offered Kamen $250,000 to chronicle the making of Ginger in a book with the help of a writer.
Kamen's work is based out of a Manchester, New Hampshire, lab called DEKA Research & Development.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the body’s defense system attacks the tissue surrounding the joints, the places where bones are joined.
The disease affects women more than men.
Researchers from the University of Alabama in Birmingham reported their study at the yearly meeting of the American College of Rheumatology in San Francisco, California.
They studied more than 31,000 women between the ages of 55 and 69.
The women were included in the Iowa Women’s Health Study from 1986 through 1997.
The researchers studied 158 women who developed rheumatoid arthritis during that period.
They also studied women who did not develop the disease.
Women who drank four or more cups of decaffeinated coffee a day were two times more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis than women who never drank decaf.
The women who drank more than three cups of tea a day had a sixty percent lower chance of developing the disease than those who never drank tea.
Researchers from Boston University in Massachusetts reported about another study.
It involved rheumatoid arthritis among 64,000 black women.
The women were involved in the Black Women’s Health Study that began in 1995.
The researchers found that drinking more than one cup of decaffeinated coffee a day seemed to increase by four times the chance of developing the disease.
However, in this study, drinking tea seemed to increase the chance of developing rheumatoid arthritis.
The researchers said they believe these are the first studies to show a link between decaf coffee and rheumatoid arthritis.
But they said people should not stop drinking decaf or tea until more studies are done.

Diplomats generally operate on the same basis.
So when the Bush Administration presented evidence to North Korean leaders that their country was developing nuclear weapons, it expected the regime to lie about it.
A day later came the shocker.
"Yes, we've been secretly working to produce nukes," a top aide to "Dear Leader" Kim Jong Il told astonished U.S. envoy James Kelly.
And, he added, "we've got more powerful weapons"
presumably meaning biological and chemical agents.
He was not apologetic at all, says a U.S. official, but "assertive, aggressive about it."
Tightly controlled countries like North Korea typically stonewall such sensitive inquiries.
So the admission did more than just confirm long-held suspicions in Washington that North Korea, a charter member in Bush's "axis of evil," had pursued weapons of mass destruction despite a 1994 agreement to stop.
Why, everyone wondered, was Kim confessing now?
And why had Bush pressed the issue, when he was already immersed in two major global confrontations?
No wonder the Administration sat on the news for 12 days while it scrambled to figure out how to downsize the crisis.
By the time the Bush team went public with the news last week, it was also trying to reassure citizens and allies that this standoff would be addressed, at least for now, with diplomacy, not military might.
So who assisted the Koreans?
Pakistan had the Bomb but no missiles to deliver it, and North Korea is the world's most active missile proliferator, especially to customers who can't shop elsewhere.
In 1998 Pakistan tested a homemade Ghauri medium-range ballistic missile that the U.S. believes originated in North Korea.
War with North Korea, Bush told his aides, was out of the question.
He could not let Kim alter the fragile balance of power on the Korean peninsula, where 37,000 U.S. troops stand across the DMZ from a million-man army close enough to destroy Seoul, South Korea's capital, in a blitzkrieg.
By Bush's own doctrine of pre-emption, the U.S. should strike against any state with weapons of mass destruction and an irresponsible dictator.
But the consequences of attacking Pyongyang are unacceptable.
What Bush apparently never anticipated was a brazen admission that the evidence was right.

Army used a high-energy laser to shoot down an artillery shell in mid-flight in a defense industry breakthrough, the Army and the manufacturer said.
The Army and TRW Inc., which developed the weapon, said in a joint statement that the laser tracked, locked onto and fired a burst of concentrated light energy photons at the speeding shell over the White Sands test range in New Mexico.
The Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL) is being developed by TRW for the Army and the Israeli Defense Ministry.
Lasers have been used in past tests at the range to shoot down slower Katyusha Rockets similar to those fired at Israel by militant guerrilla groups in neighboring Lebanon.
"This shootdown shifts the paradigm for defensive capabilities.
We've shown that even an artillery projectile hurtling through the air at supersonic speed is no match for a laser," said Army Lt.
Joseph Cosumano, head of the missile defense command.
